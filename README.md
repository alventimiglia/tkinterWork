# tkinterWork

This repository is used to house the various projects that were completed in order to work with and learn tkinter.

## dataEntryForm

This is a data entry form that would showcase a student. The data fields were relatively simple as this was a project focused on the GUI rather than the data side of things. To make future improvements, it would be helpful to make a true backend for this project for data validation.

## flashcardApp

This is an app that allows you to create and review flashcards. It utilizes tkinter for the GUI, but it is also an exploration into database usage with sqlite. There's a lot that can still be improved with this app, including the overall design, but the main purpose was to gain a further understanding of tkinter.

## quizApp

This is a relatively simple GUI that is utilizing a simple multiple choice quiz style. This project takes the principles from some of the earlier projects and builds upon it with tkinter.
