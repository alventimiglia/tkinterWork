# tkinterWork

This repository is used to house the various projects that were completed in order to work with and learn tkinter.

## dataEntryForm

This is a data entry form that would showcase a student. The data fields were relatively simple as this was a project focused on the GUI rather than the data side of things. To make future improvements, it would be helpful to make a true backend for this project for data validation.
