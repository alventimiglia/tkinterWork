# tkinterWork

This repository is used to house the various projects that were completed in order to work with and learn tkinter.

## dataEntryForm

This is a data entry form that would showcase a student. The data fields were relatively simple as this was a project focused on the GUI rather than the data side of things. To make future improvements, it would be helpful to make a true backend for this project for data validation.

## dictionaryApp

This is a simple dictionary GUI that uses the requests library to make an API call to get the information about the word that was typed in. An interesting update would be to accomodate for other languages.

## flashcardApp

This is an app that allows you to create and review flashcards. It utilizes tkinter for the GUI, but it is also an exploration into database usage with sqlite. There's a lot that can still be improved with this app, including the overall design, but the main purpose was to gain a further understanding of tkinter.

## notepad

This app is a traditional notepad. It works by storing the notes as JSON data so that they can be retrieved.

## quizApp

This is a relatively simple GUI that is utilizing a simple multiple choice quiz style. This project takes the principles from some of the earlier projects and builds upon it with tkinter.

## tictactoeGUI

This is an enhancement on a tic-tac-toe game the would normally be built for the CLI. There is the game component, the GUI component, as well as an alert component.

## whiteboard

This is a project that creates a fun whiteboard using tkinter, but really highlights the use of ttkbootstrap.
